        <p>You can:</p>
        <p>Put in a Pull Request to help us upkeep the site! You can find the public Repo HERE.</p>
        <p>Take part in the r/longfurby and r/furby communities on Reddit and be super-helpful!</p>
        <p>Do good work in the name of Furbism. Make people remember the 90's through Furbies and how being good to one another doesnt have to be driven by some weird angry man in a cloud-chair.</p>
        <p>Help us write LORE! Since all religions, books, and movies are just offshoots of one another, why not Furbism? People like familiar stories and if you enjoy a good book, have been forced to practice a religion in the past, or currently practice, you might know of a good addition to our GROWING lore! We would love to attain so much LORE LENGTH that it would warrant its own page!! If you have some Good Long Tales you'd like to add, you can contact me with those HERE.</p>

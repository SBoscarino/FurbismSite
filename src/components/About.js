          <h2>What is Furbism?</h2>
          <div className="pushIn">
            <p>Furbism is the belief in Longfurbies and generally being good to other people. We do not bully, scare, or force our patrons to expend any of their precious time with scripture, prayer, or anything else really. Nor do we collect tithes or tax dodge like other religious groups. No one has time for that. We also like furbies from the 90â€™s, especially if they are long. We enjoy crafts and creative thinking.</p>

          <h2>What the actual heck is a longfurby?</h2>
          <div className="pushIn">
            <p>If it makes you feel any better, we didn't know what one was either until we laid our eyes upon one because we are definetly not crazy.</p>
            <p>We knew we weren't crazy because others have seen The Long Ones too. Much "research" has been done on the topic.</p>
            <p>In this case, it would be best to sendith thee to the <a className="redditLink" href='https://www.reddit.com/r/LongFurbies/comments/9zlieu/welcome_to_rlongfurbies/'>longfurby subreddit</a>. Do not be alarmed if you do not know what a Reddit is. Simply scroll down the page. Please do visit if you are confused, or don't visit. We just know that humans are very visual creatures and there are many variations of the longfurby that can be safely viewed there.</p>
            <p>Some speak The Language of the Furb, others are mute. Some growl, hop, or slither their way into our hearts. There are so many options for locomotion and speech. Some even have hands (or none at all).</p>
            <p>Longfurbies come in many forms. Aquatic, space-traveling, arboreal, and sometimes even corporeal, they take many shapes, forms, and lengths. Obviously, the longer, the better. This is because longer furbies have consumed the souls of more longfurbies and regular furbies. This makes them more powerful, longer, and cooler.</p>

          <h2>General Ideals</h2>
          <div className="pushIn">
            <p>Attain length in any way possible. Buy an extended cab truck, get a hard-on, wear heels, gel your hair upward or wear it down, purchase a long jacket, get long extnded fingrnails, or just jump really high. </p>
            <p>Eat the longest and holiest foods possible.</p>
            <p>Follow (or dont) some of the Polite Requests. It'll be easy (or not).</p>
          </div>
        </div>   
        <div>
          <h2>Why Furbism?</h2>
          <div className="pushIn">
            <p>Because you're bored.</p>
            <p>Because friends are nice.</p>
            <p>Because you hate your parents and want to embarass them. What is more embarassing that being really into a long version of an annoying 90's Hasbro toy turned LONG and CRAFTY AF.</p>
            <p>You're into the arts, because many of our patrons choose to add to the Longfurby biome by creating their own interpretations of these beings. See <a className="redditLink" href='https://www.reddit.com/r/LongFurbies/comments/9zlieu/welcome_to_rlongfurbies/'>r/longfurby</a> on Reddit for more.</p>
            <p>We have lots of good ideas (and bad) and a community that is open to sharing them.</p>

          <h2>Structure of the Furbistic Ideals</h2>
          <h3>The Hierarchy</h3>
          <div className="pushIn">
            <p>TBH, we really don't follow this, but folks like structure, so adhere if you want or don't do it at all. We're chill.</p>
            <p>A. Puffy Ones: these individuals are new the cult, or maybe just exploring their options. We are open to our patrons enjoying multiple cults at once. Variety is awesome, and it is known to be the spice of life. We like flavor.</p>
            <p>B. The Long Ones: These individuals have done something nice. We don't know what it is yet but they wear very long hats and use (or don't) many of our Polite Requests. Long hats or general bodly tallness help to identify you.</p>
            <p>C. Super Saiyan 6: Unknown level of power and probably eyebrowless. Probably insane, but we like them. They run very fast.</p>

          <h2>Stories + Facts</h2>
          <div className="pushIn">
            <p>One thing all religions have in common are stories. People love and gravitate towards stories. Sometimes, stories contain factual tidbits that help us live fuller, LONGER lives.</p>
            <p>Stories help to explain different phenomena that could be explained scientifically but people would rather believe in an invisible being instead.</p>
            <p>So, just like all the other religions, we have stories. You just have to BELIEVE.</p>  
          </div>

              <h3>The Creation of the Universe / The Rupture</h3>
              <p>In the beginning there was darkness. That is because the Long One had not yet yarped up the universe as we know it. In a nutshell, there are many long furbies, all of which are invisible, unless you are either insane or maybe they might let you see them. Who knows? No one can truly know because the are gods ane we are not. They continueously eat each other in a nearly never-ending battle of cunning and a driving thirst for furb-flesh.</p>
              <p>Once the last furby stands/slithers, there will be no other furbies to eat, and will therefore begin eating the planet, and then the universe. Once it has eaten the universe, it will be very full and the universe, once full of light, will be dark like the beginning.</p>
              <p>There is major gastrointestinal upset that will occur from consuming the universe. Ths brings upon us The Rupture, specifically, The Rupture of the furby's insides and so the universe will expand from The Rupture and begin once more. Sounds like The Big Bang but it isn't because you have to believe.</p>

              <h3>Black Holes</h3>
              <p>Black holes are difficult for humans to explore because nothing escapes them.</p>
              <p>Because they remain unexplored, we cannot disprove that a black hole is actually a space-faring longfurb that has burrowed a hole in the fabric of space-time and consumes all that enter (such as light or satellites) in order to attain length.</p>

              <h3>Wind</h3>
              <p>"Science" says that wind is caused by differences in the atmospheric pressure. When a difference in atmospheric pressure exists, air moves from the higher to the lower pressure area, resulting in winds of various speeds. </p>
              <p>Who's to say that SOME wind, magical wind, is created by furby flatulence OR PERHAPS that the actual pressure of the atmosphere is not created by a VERY lengthy longfurby wrapping itself around the Earth, creating pressure.</p>

              <h3>A Feeling of Being Watched</h3>
              <p> Do you ever have the sense that you are being watched? </p>
              <p>Know that the gentle eyes of probably multiple invisible longfriends are awaiting The Rupture, and are watching over you. Or maybe they're not. It is not for us to know. They work in mysterious ways and have "a plan" or something.</p>

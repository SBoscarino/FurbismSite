        <h2>What the actual heck is a longfurby?</h2>
        <p>In this case, it would be best to sendith thee to <a className="redditLink" href='https://www.reddit.com/r/LongFurbies/comments/9zlieu/welcome_to_rlongfurbies/'>Reddit</a>. Humans are very visual creatures and there are many variations of the longfurby.</p>
        <p>Some speak The Language of the Furb, others are mute. Some growl, hop, or slither their way into our hearts. There are so many options for locomotion and speech. Some even have hands (or none at all).</p>
        <p>Longfurbies come in many forms. Aquatic, space-traveling, arboreal, and sometimes even corporeal, they take many shapes, forms, and lengths. Obviously, the longer, the better. This is because longer furbies have consumed the souls of more longfurbies and regular furbies. This makes them more powerful, longer, and cooler.</p>
      </div> 
      <div>
        <h2>General Ideals</h2>
        <p>Attain length in any way possible. Buy an extended cab truck, get a hard-on, wear heels, gel your hair upward or wear it down, purchase a long jacket, get long extnded fingrnails, or just jump really high. </p>
        <p>Eat the longest and holiest foods possible.</p>
        <p>Follow (or dont) some of the Polite Requests. It'll be easy (or not).</p>
      </div>   
      <div>
        <h2>Why Furbism?</h2>
        <p>Because you're bored.</p>
        <p>Because friends are nice.</p>
        <p>Because you hate your parents and want to embarass them. What is more embarassing that being really into a long version of an annoying 90's Hasbro toy turned LONG and CRAFTY AF.</p>
        <p>You're into the arts, because many of our patrons choose to add to the Longfurby biome by creating their own interpretations of these beings. See <a className="redditLink" href='https://www.reddit.com/r/LongFurbies/comments/9zlieu/welcome_to_rlongfurbies/'>r/longfurby</a> on Reddit for more.</p>
        <p>We have lots of good ideas (and bad) and a community that is open to sharing them.</p>

        <h2>Structure of the Furbistic Ideals</h2>
        <h3>The Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>TBH, we really don't follow this, but folks like structure, so adhere if you want or don't do it at all. We're chill.</p>
        <p>A. Puffy Ones: these individuals are new the cult, or maybe just exploring their options. We are open to our patrons enjoying multiple cults at once. Variety is awesome, and it is known to be the spice of life. We like flavor.</p>
        <p>B. The Long Ones: These individuals have done something nice. We don't know what it is yet but they wear very long hats and use (or don't) many of our Polite Requests. Long hats or general bodly tallness help to identify you.</p>
        <p>C. Super Saiyan 6: Unknown level of power and probably eyebrowless. Probably insane, but we like them. They run very fast.</p>
      </div> 
      <div>
        <h2>Stories</h2>
        <p>One thing all religions have in common are stories. People love and gravitate towards stories.</p>
        <p>Stories help to explain different phenomena that could be explained scientifically but people would rather believe in an invisible being instead.</p>
        <p>So, just like all the other religions, we have stories. You just have to BELIEVE.</p>  
          <div>
            <h3>The Creation of the Universe / The Rupture</h3>
            <p>In the beginning there was darkness. That is because the Long One had not yet yarped up the universe as we know it. In a nutshell, there are many long furbies, all of which are invisible, unless you are either insane or maybe they might let you see them. Who knows? No one can truly know because the are gods ane we are not. They continueously eat each other in a nearly never-ending battle of cunning and a driving thirst for furb-flesh.</p>
            <p>Once the last furby stands/slithers, there will be no other furbies to eat, and will therefore begin eating the planet, and then the universe. Once it has eaten the universe, it will be very full and the universe, once full of light, will be dark like the beginning.</p>
            <p>There is major gastrointestinal upset that will occur from consuming the universe. Ths brings upon us The Rupture, specifically, The Rupture of the furby's insides and so the universe will expand from The Rupture and begin once more. Sounds like The Big Bang but it isn't because you have to believe.</p>

      <h1>How to Practice</h1>
      <h2>Every religion or cult has some core tenants that create cohesion.</h2>
      <h5>Some of these things include common meeting places, common colors, logos or signs. Many groups have a secret handshake or word. Some groups share membership through a character on a t-shirt, a weird pair of pants with lots of chains, a funny hair style or hat, or piece of body language that can help one member find and single out others of a similar group.</h5>
      <div>
        <h2>The Polite Requests</h2>
        <p>We know others of our kind by seeing good works. Anyone doing nice things is SECRETLY following some Furbinistic Polite Request and probably has no idea that they are following Furbism but they totally ARE.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Food</h2>
        <p>Every group has some kind of fetish with some food or another. We, too, enjoy food!</p>
        <p>We Furbists prefer foods that are round and contain holes. Foods like doughnuts are reminiscent of the final Long One consuming itself in infinitum.</p>
        <p>Foods simply containing holes or microbes such as cheese and yogurt, are symbolic of the holes the furbies consuming the universe.</p>
        <p>We also like LONG foods, such as asparagus, carrots, leeks, or spaghetti. By consuming long foods, we are reminded of our goal to attain length.</p>
        <p>Honestly, since The Great Long One eventually consumes everything then eating anything at all is paying homage to The Great Long One.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Symbols and Signs</h2>
        <p>Every group has some kind of symbology.</p>
        <p>Not to be left hanging, we, too, have a thing!</p>
        <p>We found that the best way to strut your stuff is to make a circle with your hands, make WET LOUD mouth noises (heavy breathing or none), and give a gentle bow. Bouns points if you are wearing a Longfurby as a boa.</p>
        <p>Optionally, and especially in less casual settings, it is beneficial to keep your weird shit on the DL, so a quick bow, lip smack, or hand-circle are an acceptable way to show others that you mean well.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>How Spot a Furbist</h2>
        <p>Practicing a weird religion about invisible longfurbies is cooler with friends!</p>
        <p>With so many patrons unknowingly practicing Furbism, how do we know the ones who have achieved the most SPIRITUAL LENGTH?</p>
        <p>If someone has made or purchased a longfurby at any time in their life, they are an honorary Furbist because they are either a member of the art community or are paying an artist to make one. Awesome!</p>
        <p>Now that we think about it, the best way to find out if someone is a practicing Furbist is to JUST ASK. Worst case, the person being asked had NO IDEA that Furbism is a THING! Well, now they DO! Convert them if you so desire - or don't. We're chill.</p>
